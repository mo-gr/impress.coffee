impress.coffee
============

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and 
transitions in modern browsers

it is a direct rewrite of impress.js, which is itself inspired by prezi.com

What's the point?
-----------------

This rewrite is not intended to replace impress.js at any point. It is not even intended for real use at this point.
Instead the goal is to rewrite a small Javascript code base in Coffee Script to get a better feeling
for the language.

If you plan to make a presentation with impress.coffee, please consider using impress.js instead. If you really dare
to use impress.coffee, then please attribute Bartek Szopka. I merely recreated his work.

Any comments about it, especially about all the glaring obvious CoffeeScript rookie errors I made, are welcome :)

Usage
-----

Compile the impress.coffee file to impress.js and the example should work out of the box. The example is the
unmodified example of impress.js and therefore mentions impress.coffee at no point.
